Description: DOT (graph description language) is a simplified and intuitive
	plain text graphical language. This package not only renders the DOT
	language in R, but also provides the possibility to export the graphs
	in PostScript and SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) formats. The DOT package
	also supports literate programming packages such as 'knitr', 'rmarkdown', and 'R2HTML' seemlessly.
